The hackathon consists of multiple progressive challenges.  
Tackle as many as you can — the more you build, the better your final solution!
Be sure to check the tech_requirements folder to see if you are ready to start the challenge!

### 🧩 First Challenge: E-R diagram and database creation

-  **Download CSV file** inside the data folder, with users’ data and transactions.
